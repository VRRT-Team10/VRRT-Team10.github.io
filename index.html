<h1>Mission Statment</h1>
<p>With the development of new virtual reality (VR) technologies, strides have been made not only in video games but also for therapy. VR has the power to place the user in completely new, artificial environments. With this capability, VR has been shown to be effective in treating patients suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) through exposure therapy. VR was recently used by the Veteran’s Association (VA) to treat pain and various mental disorders in veterans in Reno. With the VR experience providing not only visual and auditory stimulation, the patient’s pain has shown to decrease, but the VA in Reno still needs to provide more data to support this claim. The VA in Reno also plans to expand the treatment to six other VA sites to see if the VR treatment can be shown to be effective in their patients as well by minimizing pain and discomfort. For this, Dr. Rumzie, an advisor for our project and the individual managing the VR treatment program, reached out to the Computer Science and Engineering department to help create a tool to aid with the research of the effectiveness of this new VR treatment. 
    The main objective of this project is to create a holistic data collection tool which provides a simple user interface to input data from the veterans’ experiences who utilize the VR treatment by permission-granted users. Our software, tentatively called Virtual Reality Research Tool, or VRRT, will allow for users to sign in, input data to the VA network, and download data using VRRT. The data will be analyzed to see trends and patterns to determine if the VR treatment is deemed effective. 
    A major emphasis was placed to not only consider the physical data, such as heart rate and blood pressure, but also data that pertains to an individual’s mental health, like user experience and other comments.
